                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>I am a Front-end Developer located in the central Florida area after just completing my Bachelor of Arts degree in Digital Arts from Stetson University. I have a passion for improving my skills in both design and development, and love finding unique and creative ways to use code to create a beautiful user experience.  In my spare time, I enjoy reading a good book, playing video games, playing my bass guitar, and learning as much as I can about web development.</p>

                    <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                    <p>My primary interest is in Front-end development. I am well-verses in HTML, CSS(SCSS), Javascript, jQuery, and php. I have also dabbled in writing svg. I am constantly looking for inspiration for good websites and  user experiences. I spend most of my idle time on CodePen playing with code or looking for new ideas to improve my own design skills. As well as web design, I also enjoy using programming for the creation of art to creative generative or interactive works that can be different every time they're viewed.</p>

            <h3>Water Scarcity Awareness Website</h3>
            <a href="http://galatea.stetson.edu/~mwood/ScarceSupply/" target="_blank"><img src="img/water-scarcity.jpg" alt="A website promoting water scarcity awareness"></a>
            <p>This project was my first attempt at a complete website with advanced features without the use of any external frameworks. Also, served as a way to put new web design techniques, such as flexbox layout, to the test. This site was made to interact with a physical installation that served to illustrate the problem.</p>

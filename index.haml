                        %h2 Who am I?
                        %p I am a Full Stack Developer located in the central Florida area after just completing my Bachelor of Arts degree in Digital Arts from Stetson University. I have a passion for improving my skills in both design and development, and love finding unique and creative ways to use code to create a beautiful user experience.  In my spare time, I enjoy reading a good book, playing video games, playing my bass guitar, and learning as much as I can about web development.

                        %h2 What do I do?
                        %p My primary interest is in Front-end development, but I have worked with other forms of development. I am well-versed in HTML5(HAML), CSS(SCSS), Javascript(Coffeescript), jQuery, and php. I have also dabbled in inline-SVG, Python, Java, C#, and C++. I am constantly looking for inspiration for good websites and  user experiences. I spend most of my idle time on CodePen playing with code or looking for new ideas to improve my own design skills. As well as web development, I also enjoy using programming for the creation of generative or interactive works that can be different every time they're viewed.

                            %img{:src=>"img/ClinicallySpeaking.jpg", :alt=>"A client of M5Design Studio"}/
                        %p For this site, I developed the wordpress theme and implemented easy backend content updating to ensure the client had an easy time maintaining their content.

                        %p I translated this client's old site into a wordpress site so they could more easily manage their content and include more advanced features more easily with the help of wordpress plugins.

                        %p This site implemented wordpress fields as a way to allow the client to easily maintain their price and service information in the backend very easily and quickly while still maintaining proper stylings.

                        %p Another client website that I developed for using wordpress. This was my first time creating a wordpress theme from a design, and began the development of my skills with PHP.

                            %img{:src=>"img/water-scarcity.jpg", :alt=>"A website promoting water scarcity awareness"}/
                        %p This project was my first attempt at a complete website with advanced features without the use of any external frameworks. Also, served as a way to put new web design techniques, such as flexbox layout, to the test. This site was made to interact with a physical installation that served to illustrate the problem.

                        %p A codepen pen exploring the use of trigonometry for the use of cyclical drawing and animation using the javascript canvas library. This was developed as practice with the javascript canvas library.

                        %p A codepen pen I developed as a way to practice with the javascript canvas library and to explore the use of canvas to create clean animated graphs.

                        %h3 Life's a Glitch series
                        %p Life's a Glitch is a series that seeks to reveal the beauty of every day life even in the most mundane tasks. I wrote a program in the Processing programming environment that receives motion tracking data from Max/MSP. It uses this data to draw generate an image based on the motion of the user. I then took the generated images and did a technique called databending using an audio editing program call Audacity. The first image was generated with a video of driving. The second is an image of me folding laundry. And the last image is an image of me eating dinner.

                        %h3 RGBCubism
                        %p RGBCubism is a response to Cubist landscape compositions made for my Advanced Open Studio course. I was tasked with combining both a classic and modern technique. I wrote a Proccessing sketch that uses OpenGL to render 3D cubes to create the different compositions and choose a color scheme for each image.

                %p Visual experiments using Processing to learn the math associated in basic animation to be later implemented in Javascript. This was a response to a prompt given in my Advanced Open Studio class.
